# You are given a 0-indexed m x n binary matrix grid.

# A 0-indexed m x n difference matrix diff is created with the following procedure:

# Let the number of ones in the ith row be onesRowi.
# Let the number of ones in the jth column be onesColj.
# Let the number of zeros in the ith row be zerosRowi.
# Let the number of zeros in the jth column be zerosColj.
# diff[i][j] = onesRowi + onesColj - zerosRowi - zerosColj
# Return the difference matrix diff.
